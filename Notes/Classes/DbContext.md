Scenario | How Many DbContexts? | Why
Simple CRUD API | One | One database, one logical unit of work.
Large App with Clear Domain Separation (e.g., Billing vs Users) | Multiple | Different DbContexts to separate responsibility and avoid collisions.
Multiple Databases (e.g., SQL Server + MongoDB) | One per database type | Each DbContext connects to one database; helps with scaling.
Multi-Tenant Systems | One shared or multiple depending on isolation | You might have one DbContext per tenant for isolation/security.
Microservices | One per service | Each service owns its own database and context (Database per Service pattern).

# What happen in bigger apps?

1. Your have **User Management** (Account, Profiles)
2. You have **Billing System** (Invoice, Payments)
3. You have **Product Catalog** (Items, Categories)

DbContext | Contains
UserDbContext | Users, Profiles, Roles
BillingDbContext | Invoices, Payments
CatalogDbContext | Products, Categories

Each would have its own connection string (sometimes) and own migration history.
Each one would be registered separately in Program.cs.

Example:

```
builder.Services.AddDbContext<UserDbContext>(...);
builder.Services.AddDbContext<BillingDbContext>(...);
builder.Services.AddDbContext<CatalogDbContext>(...);
```
